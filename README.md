# ðŸ§  NeuralGuru Backend (`ng-backend`)

## Overview

`ng-backend` is the core backend service of the **NeuralGuru** platform â€” a virtual learning environment (VLE) that manages users, materials, assessments, tutor scheduling, analytics, and integrations with external microservices.

This service exposes RESTful APIs for the frontend applications and communicates with supporting microservices such as `ng-payment` for financial transactions.

## Architecture

- **Framework:** NestJS (Modular Monolith with microservice-ready design)
- **Database:** MongoDB (via Mongoose)
- **File Storage:** AWS S3
- **Microservices:**
  - `ng-payment` â€” external service handling payment processing and gateway integrations
  - Future services may include AI diagnostics or notification handlers

## Core Capabilities

- Role-based authentication and authorization (Student, Tutor, Parent, Admin)
- Material management (upload and serve PDFs, videos, notes)
- Quiz and assessment system with score tracking
- Tutor profile management and session booking
- Performance analytics and report generation
- Secure integration with the `ng-payment` microservice for handling transactions

## Integration with `ng-payment`

`ng-backend` communicates with the `ng-payment` microservice to handle all payment-related operations, including:

- Payment session creation and validation
- Transaction status updates
- Refunds and reconciliation

**Communication Pattern:**
Primarily via RESTful API (`/api/payments`), with optional support for asynchronous messaging (RabbitMQ or gRPC) in scalable environments.
